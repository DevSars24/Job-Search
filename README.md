## 🔒 **Authentication Flow (Clerk)**

1. User lands → If not logged in → Redirect to **/?sign-in=true**
2. After login → If user has no role metadata
   → Redirect to **/onboarding**
3. Onboarding sets:

```
unsafeMetadata.role = "candidate" | "recruiter"
```

4. Protected routes check:

* must be logged in
* must have role
* recruiters can post/manage jobs
* candidates can apply/view saved jobs

## 🧠 **How API Layer Works (Interview Style)**

Your API functions inside `api/` follow this pattern:

```js
export async function functionName(token, params, bodyData) {
  const supabase = await supabaseClient(token);
  // Query
  return response;
}
```

This gives 3 HUGE benefits:

### Benefit 1️⃣ – **Full RLS Protection**

Supabase rules run because token = logged in user's JWT.

### Benefit 2️⃣ – **Clean React Components**

Components do NOT contain backend logic.

### Benefit 3️⃣ – **Standardized API Architecture**

---

# 🧩 **Important API Explanations**

### ⭐ 1. Apply to Job

* Upload resume to storage
* Get public URL
* Insert into applications table

### ⭐ 2. Add Company

* Upload company logo
* Insert into table

### ⭐ 3. Get Jobs

* Includes filters (location, company, searchQuery)
* Joined with `saved_jobs` and `companies`

### ⭐ 4. Save Job Toggle

* If saved → delete
* If not → insert

### ⭐ 5. Update Hiring Status

Recruiter changes job status (open/closed).

---

# 🔄 **useFetch() — Custom API Hook**

Your universal API hook:

* manages loading
* manages error
* manages token
* returns a function to execute API

```
const { loading, data, error, fn } = useFetch(apiFunction)
```

This pattern is **enterprise-grade**.

---

## 🎨 UI Architecture (ShadCN + Tailwind)

### Drawer

Used for modals (Add Company, Apply Job)

### Card

Used for JobCard, ApplicationCard

### Select

For filters, hiring status, company selection

---

# 🚀 Run Locally

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### 2️⃣ Add environment variables

Create `.env`:

```
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
VITE_CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

### 3️⃣ Run server

```
npm run dev
```

---

# 🌐 Deployment Steps (Vercel)

1. Push repo to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Add same `.env` variables
4. Deploy

Supabase works automatically since URL + KEY provided.
